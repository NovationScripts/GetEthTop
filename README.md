**GetEthTop: Path to Million Dollar Wealth and Additional ERC-20 Token Rewards.**

**Overview:** 
"**GetEthTop**" is a blockchain game designed to provide users with the opportunity to become millionaires (~$) and earn liquid ERC-20 tokens by progressing through levels (11 levels in total). Players can engage in a unique reward system, earning income from referrals and advancing through a series of increasingly challenging levels. Once the game is completed, it cannot be restarted from the same wallet.

**Registration and Conditions:** 

To start playing, users need to register (except for the contract owner, who is automatically registered), specifying a referrer.

New players cannot be registered without a referrer, ensuring a chain of participants.

  **Gameplay:**

This game is for people! For those who don't understand mathematics and liquidity well, let's clarify: this is not a Ponzi scheme; it's a redistribution of funds. We don't take away; We provide opportunities. The earnings of the contract will be redirected to the initial liquidity of the token, which will be awarded for completing levels. We're not just creating initial liquidity for our token but also providing an opportunity for everyone to attain prosperity through the gaming process. The main goal of the game process is to attract new players to maintain the stability of the game.

1. The contract owner is the first registered referrer.

2. To register, players must specify a referrer.

3. A referrer can start accumulating profit from each referral's deposit on each level, only if the referrer completes 10 steps on the first level.

4. There are levels in the game, each level has its own budget, and each level has a fixed number of steps, where each step involves making a deposit and receiving a payout.

5. When a player makes a deposit, a portion of the funds is distributed among the referrer, the contract's earnings, and the level's budget.

6. A player can request a payout only after the default waiting time from the moment of the last deposit has passed. Before requesting a payout, a player can check for free whether the payout is available at their level, and also check the state of the budget at their level. In case of a failed payout attempt, the player will face a waiting time again, which will decrease by one hour after each failed payout attempt.

<i>Recommendations: Firstly, you need to request your payout in a timely manner in accordance with your waiting queue. However, if you have missed your time slot or see that the budget of your level is insufficient for the payout, then check the budget status of your level and do not request a payout if the budget of your level does not cover your payout several times, this ensures that you are more likely to receive the payout the first time and will not need to pay gas for a failed payout attempt, as well as getting additional waiting time. Invite new referrals to the game this will help increase the budgets of levels, as well as bring you additional profit.</i>

7. After receiving a payout for the last deposit, the number of steps a player has completed on the current level increases, after completing all the steps on the current level, the player moves to the next level. After a player moves to the next level, they cannot make steps on the previous level. After completing the last level, the player's status changes to "finished the game" and the player cannot start the game again from the same wallet.

8. A player can take the next step on the current level only after receiving a payout for the last deposit.

9. The game includes rewards for completing levels, which are implemented in a separate contract. These rewards entail receiving liquid tokens, which can be decentralizedly exchanged for liquid cryptocurrency.

10. 1% of each player's deposit at every level except the first level is transferred to the budget of the first level.

11. Any Ethereum network user can donate to the budget of the first level, even if they are not registered in the game.

12. When the contract owner withdraws the contract's earnings, the contract's earnings are transferred to the account of the liquid token contract used for level completion rewards.

13. When the contract owner withdraws the contract's earnings, a certain percentage goes into the budget of the first level.

14. When a referrer withdraws their earnings, a certain percentage of their earnings goes into the budget of the first level.

15. The contract owner can change the default waiting time after the last deposit if the budget of the first level accumulates too quickly due to a constant influx of new players, or decrease the waiting time if the influx of players is too slow.

16. This game implies that a player needs to spend their own money only for registration, making the first deposit, and paying for gas. After making the first deposit at the first level, a player should always be in profit in order to continue playing. Even if a player overspends a little on gas, they can make up for it with earnings from referrals and continue the game to the finish.

17. With each level, the cost of a step increases, and the profit after the payout for the current step increases, making gas expenses increasingly insignificant with each new level.

18. The number of levels, the number of steps for each level, and the cost of each step can be calculated and altered before the contract deployment, but in such a way that the player can continue the game and reach the finish while minimizing the budget expenditures.

19. The main goal of finishing is equivalent to a total player profit of $1,000,000.

To maintain optimal liquidity and ensure the stability of the reward system, earnings from the game contract are directed to the token contract address. This ensures that the amount of rewards is commensurate with and does not exceed the total earnings of the game contract, thereby providing a balanced and sustainable economic mechanism.  

**Game Objective:** 

The main goal of the game is to complete all levels, maximizing earnings and potentially achieving millionaire status (~$).
The game offers an engaging and profitable way to earn in the cryptocurrency world, combining elements of strategy, luck, and social networking.

**Risks**

**Initial Deposit and Referral Activity**

The primary risk in the GetEthTop game is associated with the initial deposit of 0.01 ETH. This is the only amount that players need to invest from their own funds. All subsequent steps in the game and progression through the levels are funded by the profits earned during the gameplay.

A key factor in a player's success is the active recruitment of new participants. The effectiveness of the referral system and a playerâ€™s ability to expand their network directly influence their potential earnings and progression through the levels. It's important to note that the game involves a degree of social interaction and network marketing, which can be both an advantage and a challenge, depending on individual skills and preferences.

It is crucial to understand that, despite the potential for significant earnings, the game includes elements of risk inherent to all investment and gaming platforms. Players are advised to invest funds whose loss would not be critical to their financial situation.

**Dependency of the Game on the Number of Participants**

The key aspect of our game is its dependency on the number of participants. This game is designed to create a dynamic and interactive community, where the activity and engagement of each player contribute to the overall development and progress. The more participants join the game, the more exciting and varied the gameplay becomes.

The game is structured in a way that both success and satisfaction from playing increase with the growing number of players. This not only fosters a lively and dynamic atmosphere but also enriches the gaming experience of each participant. We encourage new players to join our community, contributing to the development and expansion of this engaging gaming world.

It is important to understand that the long-term sustainability and success of the game largely depend on the active participation and interaction of players. Therefore, we encourage our members to share their experiences, invite new players, and collectively build an exciting gaming environment.
